# Day100-Determinants_of_Earnings
Analysis on "The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth" 1997-2011 dataset.

# Linear Regression Analysis
This project focuses on performing linear regression analysis using a dataset to predict earnings based on years of schooling and work experience. The analysis utilizes the popular machine learning library scikit-learn to build and evaluate a linear regression model.

# Objective
The objective of this project is to explore the relationship between earnings, years of schooling, and work experience using linear regression. The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate earnings based on these two variables.

# Tools and Technologies Used
Python.

Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.

# Key Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning to handle missing values and ensure data quality.

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

Utilizing scikit-learn's LinearRegression class to build a linear regression model.

Evaluating the model's performance using the coefficient of determination (r-squared) metric.

Visualization of the estimated earnings, actual earnings, and residuals.
